Title: Min Heap ADT Implementation Using Array Data Structure

Description:
This project presents an implementation of a minimum heap abstract data type (ADT) using an array data structure in C++. A min heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

In this implementation, we utilize an array to represent the structure of the heap. The elements of the array correspond to the nodes of the heap, with each element storing a value. The heap property is maintained by performing necessary operations on the array, such as insertion, deletion, and heapify.

The project provides a set of functions that adhere to the min heap ADT to perform various operations on the heap. These operations include inserting a new element, deleting the minimum element, checking if the heap is empty, and displaying the contents of the heap.

By using an array to implement the min heap, this project offers a compact and efficient data structure that can efficiently handle heap operations. The implementation is designed to be easily understandable, allowing both beginners and experienced programmers to grasp the concepts and logic behind a min heap using an array.

Whether you're learning about heaps or looking for a practical implementation reference, this project can serve as a valuable resource. You can explore the code, study the algorithms used for heap operations, and adapt the implementation to suit your specific needs.

Feel free to dive into this project, understand the inner workings of a min heap using an array, and leverage this knowledge in your own applications or projects.
